This file enables the portable mode for the program.

If this file is present in the root directory of the program, settings and plugins will be stored in it. Otherwise, they will be stored in the appdata directory.
Furthermore, this enables the self-contained mode, meaning plugins will be able to be installed from the plugin browser.
You can safely delete this file if you don't want the program to have this behavior.
