QtTube is a minimalist, cross-platform desktop app for streaming media. Watch videos and listen to music from the platforms you already useâ€”without the bloat or tracking, but with the core features and functionality you expect. Log in to a platform to sync your activity, so you can switch to the official app when needed without missing a beat.

# Installation
All official releases for QtTube can be found on the [Releases page](https://github.com/BowDown097/QtTube/releases).

The latest development versions can be found [here](https://nightly.link/BowDown097/QtTube/workflows/build/master). These may have new features and fixes, but being on the bleeding edge, a stable experience is not guaranteed.
